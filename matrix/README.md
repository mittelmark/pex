## Introduction

This was an exercise in Summer  semester  2021,  implementing  a basic  matrix
class using std::vector data structures,  namespaces and operator  overloading
features.  The testing code in main  illustrates  the  requirement  for better
testing   facilities   for  instance   using  a  unit  testing   library  like
[doctest](https://github.com/doctest/doctest).

## Files

- [dcutils.cpp](dcutils.cpp) - with class `dcutils::Minimat` exercising:
    - object oriented programming
    - operator overloading
    - using data structure std::vector
    - using templates
    - using namespaces
    - motivating the use of testing frameworks
- [IMatrix.Cpp](IMatrix.cpp) - more complete matrix class from SS2023 with functions like
autonames, extend, setting and getting rownames etc
