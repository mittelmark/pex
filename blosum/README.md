## Introduction

This was an exercise in  Summer  semester  2022,  implementing  a terminal tool
that could retrieve values of a Blossum matrix.

## Files

- [Blosum.cpp](Blosum.cpp) -  exercising:
    - input and output operators
    - class and function definition
    - overwriting operators
    - embedding data tables as code 
    - parsing space separated files
    - using STL structures like std::vector
