## Introduction

This project deals with extracting  information from Gene Ontology (GO) files.
The GO deals with a structured  vocabulary  for genes and proteins to annotate
them with terms from the domains "molecular  function",  "biological  process"
and     "cellular     component".     Information     can    be    found    on
https://www.gene-omtology.org

## Files

- [GoUtils.cpp](GoUtils.cpp) - simple starting class to demonstrate:
    - basic parsing of command line options using argc and argv variables
    - outline of a class with public methods
    - working with regular  expression  from command line argument  checks and
    text extraction
    - file  opening and looping  over a file using flag  variables  to extract
    parts of the file and breaking as early as possible out of the files while loop
